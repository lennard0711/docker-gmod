# A containerized GMod Server (Under Development)
This is a Docker Container for a completly customizable GMod Server.

## What works
- Installing the Server
- Adding CSS and TF2 Files
- Manually (!) starting the server in the container

## Known Bugs
- The Server doesn't start properly - [Issue](https://github.com/lennard7001/docker-gmod/issues/1)

## TODO
- Automatic server startup
- adding a Server.cfg
- adding the ENV variables for the server conf
- Documenting everything
